# Elliptic_and_Hyperbolic_PDE_Solvers
This folder is just old homework assignments from my graduate school days. Taking a year long course in Elliptic and Hyperbolic equations is what originally got me interested in mathematical coding. Unfortunately, I have not found time or reason to return to my old homeworks and projects so as to touch them up and make them more presentable since my graduate school days in which I was just learning how to use python. Nevertheless, specific references are made throughout the readme files to certain lines of code, so though the code is innefficient and disorganized, an explanation IS there.
